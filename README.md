# Iranian_names
This is a trend explorer for Iranian names based on leaked data from Mellat Bank. The main explorer can be accessed through https://iraniannamestrend.netlify.app. The website features a database of 31,600 names and displays trends over the years 1330 to 1399 (1951 to 2020). In the data, the ratio on the Y-axis is calculated as follows:

$\sum X_{i,my} =$ the sum of people who born at a month $m of year $y$ and their first name is $i$

$\sum X_{my} =$ the sum of people who born at a month $m of year $y$ regardless of their first name.


$R=\frac{\sum X_{my}}{\sum X_{my}}$ is our variable of intrest.
